This is the Broccoli & Co challenge app. Basically just a form that sends a request to a server with the users name and email address.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Running tests

```bash
yarn test
```
